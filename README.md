Project Title:
"Scalable Distributed Video Processing System Using Parallel Computing"

Project Overview:
The system will take a video file as input, split it into frames, distribute the frames across multiple worker nodes (distributed computing), and apply parallel processing on each node to analyse the frames efficiently (parallel computing).
This will cover the major concepts of both parallel and distributed systems:
✅ Parallel Computing Concepts: Multithreading (OpenMP, GPU acceleration optional).
✅ Distributed Computing Concepts: Task distribution, worker nodes, message passing (MPI or sockets).
